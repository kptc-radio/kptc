# kptc
Kptc is a Qt application for operating comfortable with the SCS PTC-II ( or PTC-IIe, PTC-IIpro)

## Build kptc
Kptc depends on Qt 5, the needed modules are core, gui and widgets. 

The following way should work:

qmake . 

make 

Maybe the qmake binary has another name (e. g. under openSUSE qmake-qt5).

But this does not work currently with openSUSE (I do not know why). But to build kptc there, run build from QtCreator, that works fine.

Please note that is a beta version.
